	// When a TCP sender detects segment loss using the retransmission timer
	// and the given segment has not yet been resent by way of the
	// retransmission timer, the value of ssthresh MUST be set to no more
	// than the value given in equation (4):
	// 
	//	   ssthresh = max (FlightSize / 2, 2*SMSS)			(4)
	// 
	// where, as discussed above, FlightSize is the amount of outstanding
	// data in the network.
	// 
	// On the other hand, when a TCP sender detects segment loss using the
	// retransmission timer and the given segment has already been
	// retransmitted by way of the retransmission timer at least once, the
	// value of ssthresh is held constant.

	}

	// Further, if the SYN or SYN/ACK is lost, the initial window used by a
	// sender after a correctly transmitted SYN MUST be one segment
	// consisting of at most SMSS bytes.

	// Furthermore, upon a timeout (as specified in [RFC2988]) cwnd MUST be
	// set to no more than the loss window, LW, which equals 1 full-sized
	// segment (regardless of the value of IW).  Therefore, after
	// retransmitting the dropped segment the TCP sender uses the slow start
	// algorithm to increase the window from 1 full-sized segment to the new
	// value of ssthresh, at which point congestion avoidance again takes
	// over.

	// Both aforementioned comments are implemented by setting CWND to MSS
	s->snd_cwnd = s->snd_mss;
